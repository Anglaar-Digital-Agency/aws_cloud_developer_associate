<h2>To make use of AWS we need to be able to access it</h2>

<h3>Well we have three ways of accesing AWS, which are as follows</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using the standard AWS console</li>
  <li>Using the AWS CLI(Command Line Interface) either on your device or the AWS CloudShell</li>
  <li>Using the AWS SDK </li>
</ul>
