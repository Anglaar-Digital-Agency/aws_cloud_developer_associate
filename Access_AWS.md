# AWS ACCESSIBILITY
<h2>To make use of AWS we need to be able to access it</h2>

<h3>Well we have three ways of accesing AWS, which are as follows</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using the standard AWS console</li>
  <li>Using the AWS CLI(Command Line Interface) either on your device or the AWS CloudShell</li>
  <li>Using the AWS SDK </li>
</ul>

To use the amazon CLI you'll need to get your CLI installed from AWS website then after that, you'll configure your access keys.
Try to make sure your access keys secrets are not revealed to someone else.
then you type in the code below 
```
aws --version
```

This is to check if your CLI installed successfully
