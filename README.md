 # AWS IAM
<h2>Identity and Access Management</h2>

AWS IAM is way of creating an identity or a user and grouping them into groups or leaving them, making sure they are on a premission policy on what service to use in AWS. What I meant was that with IAM, you can create groups and then
create users within such groups. Each user can be in multiple groups and each one of them have a permission policy on form of a JSON format. This JSON format states what service is AWS they have permission to use and how to use them.
Making use of an AWS IAM account is better than using your root user account as this is more secure to use.
But you cannot add groups in groups.
The root user sohuld be only used for creating an IAM user but not be used for any other thing or shared.

  After controlling the market, they scattered a lot of regions and availability zones across the planet to ensure their services are worldwide and the issue of latency is a no no.
