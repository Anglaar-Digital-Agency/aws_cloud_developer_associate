 # AWS IAM
<h2>Identity and Access Management</h2>

AWS IAM is way of creating an identity or a user and grouping them into groups or leaving them, making sure they are on a premission policy on what service to use in AWS. What I meant was that with IAM, you can create groups and then
create users within such groups. Each user can be in multiple groups and each one of them have a permission policy on form of a JSON format. This JSON format states what service is AWS they have permission to use and how to use them.
Making use of an AWS IAM account is better than using your root user account as this is more secure to use.
But you cannot add groups in groups.
The root user sohuld be only used for creating an IAM user but not be used for any other thing or shared.

# Beginning of AWS
<h2>AWS history</h2>
<p>AWS dated back to amazon e-commerce company where they felt the strength of their server infratrusture in 2002 and started innternally, It was in 2003 they realized they could make things such as IT for other people. In 2004, the AWS came up with a plan to create Amazon SQS and then upgraded to S3, EC2 in 2006. Now back today as they have taken over 47% of the cloud industry and have generated over 38 billion dollars in revenue, with Microsoft Azure being behind them taking up over 22% of the market</p>

<p>
  After controlling the market, they scattered a lot of regions and availability zones across the planet to ensure their services are worldwide and the issue of latency is a no no.

# AWS ACCESSIBILITY
<h2>To make use of AWS we need to be able to access it</h2>

<h3>Well we have three ways of accesing AWS, which are as follows</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using the standard AWS console</li>
  <li>Using the AWS CLI(Command Line Interface) either on your device or the AWS CloudShell</li>
  <li>Using the AWS SDK </li>
</ul>

![aws_cloud_shell](https://github.com/Ham12-3/aws_cloud_developer_associate/assets/93613316/d2c556d0-ce9f-4902-a360-0ff44f93763a)

To use the amazon CLI you'll need to get your CLI installed from AWS website then after that, you'll configure your access keys.
Try to make sure your access keys secrets are not revealed to someone else.
then you type in the code below 
```
aws --version
```

This is to check if your CLI installed successfully

Then after that you'll configure AWS, using the following command:
```
aws configure
```

# The Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a managed service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. Think of it as a sophisticated traffic cop for your cloud applications, ensuring smooth flow and preventing bottlenecks.



Here's how the ALB works:

* **Distributes traffic:** When a user visits your website or uses your application, their request hits the ALB. The ALB then intelligently routes the request to one of your available targets, ensuring everyone gets served quickly and efficiently.
* **Scales on demand:** As your traffic fluctuates, the ALB automatically scales up or down its resources to handle the load. This means you avoid paying for idle capacity during low traffic periods, and your users never experience slowdowns during peak times.
* **Enhances security:** The ALB offers built-in DDoS protection and TLS encryption to safeguard your applications from malicious attacks and protect sensitive data.
* **Provides insights:** The ALB offers detailed monitoring and reporting tools, giving you visibility into your traffic patterns and application health. This information helps you identify and troubleshoot issues before they impact your users.

**Key benefits of using the ALB:**

* **Improved performance:** Reduces website loading times and enhances user experience.
* **Increased scalability:** Adapts to fluctuating traffic without manual intervention.
* **Enhanced security:** Protects your applications from attacks and data breaches.
* **Simplified management:** Provides a centralized platform for managing your application infrastructure.
* **Reduced costs:** Pay only for the resources you use, thanks to automatic scaling.

**Who can benefit from the ALB?**

* **Web developers:** Distribute traffic across web servers to ensure optimal performance.
* **App developers:** Scale mobile and web applications effortlessly.
* **DevOps engineers:** Streamline application management and automate scaling.
* **Anyone running cloud applications:** Improve performance, security, and scalability.

**In simple terms, the ALB is like having a highly trained traffic control center for your applications.** It keeps traffic flowing smoothly, protects your applications from harm, and gives you full visibility into what's happening. This makes it a valuable tool for any organization running applications in the cloud.

I hope this explanation clarifies what the Amazon ALB is and how it can benefit you. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!

## Imagine a group of friends... but for your cloud servers!

Think of an **Amazon Auto Scaling Group** as a team of virtual servers working together to handle your application's workload, just like a group of friends helping each other with a task. Each server is like a friend, and the group scales up or down automatically based on your needs.

Here's how it works:

**1. You set the desired number of servers in the group:** This is like deciding how many friends you need to help with the task.

**2. Servers automatically spin up or down:** If your website traffic suddenly increases, new servers are added to the group like more friends pitching in. Conversely, if things quiet down, some servers can take a break or even leave the group.

**3. Servers are always healthy and working:** Just like reliable friends, Amazon Auto Scaling continuously monitors the health of each server and replaces any unhealthy ones quickly, ensuring your application keeps running smoothly.

**4. You pay only for what you use:** This is like splitting the bill among your friends. You only pay for the servers that are actually working, not for the ones on standby.

**Benefits of using Amazon Auto Scaling Groups:**

* **Cost-effective:** No more overpaying for unused resources.
* **Highly available:** Your application stays up and running even during traffic spikes.
* **Scalable:** Easily handle changing demand without manual intervention.
* **Manageable:** Simplify your infrastructure management and focus on your application.

**Here's an analogy to help you visualize:**

* **Think of your website as a restaurant.** During peak hours, you need more waiters (servers) to handle the influx of customers. But during off-peak hours, you don't need as many. Amazon Auto Scaling is like having a team of waiters who automatically show up when needed and disappear when they're not, saving you money on labor costs.

**In short, Amazon Auto Scaling Groups take the guesswork out of server scaling, giving you a reliable and cost-effective way to handle fluctuating demand for your cloud resources.**

I hope this explanation helps! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions.
